Released on October 28, 2023

## Brief introduction

Fedionfire.stream uses the Mastodon Streaming API to fetch statuses from [fedi.buzz](https://fedi.buzz). All statuses are public and are not stored on our servers. Statuses are removed from the DOM after 50 statuses are reached. The script also respects the user's privacy settings, so if the user has set their account to be private, the script will not fetch their statuses and if the user has deleted their status, the script will remove it from the DOM too. The script also does not store any information about the user, such as their IP address, browser, etc.
